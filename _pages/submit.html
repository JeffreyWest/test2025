											<li>Each minisymposium should have a designated lead organiser, and a maximum of two co-organisers. Organisers should ensure they assemble a diverse speaker list, and that all speakers have agreed to participate in the minisymposium by the time of submission. </li>
Participants will be allowed to give a maximum of two minisymposium talks at the conference. The second talk must be in a different area of math biology or education.</li>
